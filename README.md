# Flight-Booking-System

A console based simple flight booking system i made as a high-school student for practical assessment as part of curriculum.

The motive is demonstrate how MySQL and Python could be used together.

Although this project is no longer actively maintained for obvious reasons, i would definitely be checking out any issues (not feature requests) if raised, and would also resolve them positively ASAP. Pull requests are fully welcome.
